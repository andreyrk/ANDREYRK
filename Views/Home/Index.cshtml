                A little about me :)
            </h1>

            I’m a team player, I value respect and trust and like keeping the workplace healthy, plus everyone’s more
            productive that way. And while I appreciate the autonomy when alone with a task, I don’t feel ashamed to 
            seek help if I’m stuck.
            <br /><br />

            Pragmatic thinking is prevalent in my work philosophy and client’s requests are often rough stones that 
            need shaping and polishing, it is part of my responsibility to question key points and help them arrive
            at a more robust idea, but sometimes there are bigger forces driving the winds and I don’t take it 
            personally.
            <br /><br />

            I’m a proactive quick learner and self-taught programmer, I’m comfortable writing and speaking English and
            have a good interpretation of the nuances in more complex contexts. During my free time I enjoy reading 
            books and articles, cooking, playing video games and moderating a brazilian programming community, plus, on
            the weekends I volunteer on some non-profit organizations.
